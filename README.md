# Restaurant-Insights-Analysis-and-Prediction


#Problem Statement  


#Level 1: Data Exploration and Analysis

Objective: Gain foundational skills in data exploration, descriptive analysis, and geospatial insights for a restaurant dataset.

Tasks: Explore data structure, address missing values, perform data conversions, and analyze class imbalances. Calculate statistical measures, investigate distributions of categorical variables, and identify top cuisines and cities.

Significance: Develop foundational data science skills for the restaurant industry and data-driven decision-making.

#Level 2: Advanced Analysis

Objective: Enhance insights from the restaurant dataset through tasks focused on table booking, delivery services, pricing, and feature engineering.

Tasks: Calculate percentages of table booking and online delivery, compare ratings for restaurants with and without booking, and analyze online delivery availability. Determine the most common price range, calculate average ratings for each price range, and associate colors with top-rated ranges. Leverage feature engineering techniques for enhanced data intelligence.

Significance: Deepen understanding and provide valuable insights into customer preferences, services, pricing, and data enrichment.

#Level 3: Predictive Modeling and Insights

Objective: Perform predictive modeling, customer preference analysis, and data visualization to extract deeper insights.

Tasks: Build regression models to predict restaurant ratings, evaluate model performance, and compare algorithms. Analyze the relationship between cuisine types and ratings, identify popular cuisines, and determine specific cuisines with higher ratings. Create visualizations to depict rating distributions, compare average ratings, and visualize feature relationships.

Significance: Enhance decision-making, understand customer preferences, and predict restaurant ratings, offering comprehensive insights into the dataset.
